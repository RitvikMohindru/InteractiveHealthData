    <h2>Writeup</h2>
    <h4>What have we done so far?</h4>
    <p>
      We finalized the structure for our webpage visualization, as shown above.
      We figured out which visualizations are most effective and expressive to
      show on our webpage. We also created a radar chart to show the
      relationship between the gamified vs. non-gamified surveys and
      physiological response over time. We are in the process of implementing
      the rest of our visualizations through D3.js, as well as the
      narrative-style, and-but-therefore structured webpage.
    </p>
    <h4>
      What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?
    </h4>
    <p>
      The most challenging part in our project to design would be the
      and-but-therefore structure. This is because we are, at the moment,
      struggling to figure out how to integrate this into our narrative-style
      webpage. We understand what it means, and we have finalized the "and" and
      "therefore" parts; however, we have yet to determine the "but" part. This
      will be the most challenging part, as we need to find a way to introduce
      and solve the "obstacle" that adds complexity to our narrative.
